# Tableau
Internship in Tableau at QAAgility Technologies
During my internship as a Data Analyst, I contributed to the development of an HR Analytics dashboard using Tableau. The objective was to analyze the attrition rate within the organization. The dashboard served as an intuitive and interactive platform, empowering HR professionals to efficiently pinpoint the factors influencing employee turnover. This enabled them to proactively identify strategies for retaining valuable employees.
